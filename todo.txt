- add p12 to parameter array, somehow
- Much longer run (+ thin ? ), RW less efficient for sure
  - 20k should be fine 
  - thin back to the sample number of samples as the other stages?
  - Ideally I would thin back to the effective sample size
- read samples into plot maker
- compare various stage one samples

- checkpoints.
- compute the energy usage for this sim?
